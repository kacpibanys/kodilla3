    <b><h2>Momentary Bliss</h2></b>
    <p><i>by Gorillaz</i></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>[Intro: 2-D]<br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
        Momentary bliss<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Isaac Holman]<br>
        We could do so much better than this<br>
        Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss<br>
        We could do so much better than this<br>
        Oh, Rita, oh, Rita<br>
        <br>
        [Segue: 2-D]<br>
        Lovely Rita, meter maid<br>
        Lovely Rita, meter maid<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 1: slowthai & 2-D]<br>
        Your potential, you lack credentials<br>
        And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)<br>
        Oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed<br>
        And you keep squeezing the tube from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)<br>
        You part the seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)<br>
        And you was gagging for some gags so now you're rolling (Woo)<br>
        Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)<br>
        On another note, compliments make me blush<br>
        There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change<br>
        Cavern of your mind, you say you're patterned<br>
        You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say (Ah, ah, ah)<br>
        "What was scripted, the day before it happened?"<br>
        We all give applause when people open doors<br>
        But on the way out it did your back in<br>
        See, everything in life ain't silver and gold<br>
        But mining for metal gave you platinum<br>
        <br>
        [Refrain: slowthai]<br>
        It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin<br>
        It's wearing thin to think light bulb don't blink<br>
        It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers<br>
        You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners<br>
        Makes me sick<br>
        <br>
        [Bridge: 2-D]<br>
        Poster boy (Ayy)<br>
        Poster girl (Rita)<br>
        In truth, the bills (The bills)<br>
        Must be paid (Yeah, yeah, alright)<br>
        Poster boy (Yeah, alright)<br>
        Poster girl (Ah, that's time)<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2: 2-D]<br>
        In truth, the bills, they must be paid (Uh-huh)<br>
        And what is left is sodden cake, typical<br>
        Oh, you need to change your face<br>
        You're getting sold, it's such a waste<br>
        Y'know, we could do so much better than this<br>
        Swimming in pools of momentary bliss<br>
        Where you gotta bite the bounty 'cause everybody taking it<br>
        Meanwhile, you keep on adding<br>
        How big you gonna grow?<br>
        <br>
        [Refrain: slowthai]<br>
        It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin<br>
        It's wearing thin, to think light bulb don't blink<br>
        It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers<br>
        You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners<br>
        It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin<br>
        It's wearing thin, to think light bulbs don't blink<br>
        It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers<br>
        You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners<br>
        Makes me sick<br>
        
        [Chorus: Isaac Holman]<br>
        We could do so much better than this<br>
        Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss<br>
        We could do so much better than this<br>
        Oh, Rita, oh, Rita<br>
        We could do so much better than this<br>
        Perfect little pictures of moments that we missed<br>
        We could do so much better than this<br>
        Oh, Rita, oh, Rita</p>
